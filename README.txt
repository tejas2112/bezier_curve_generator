Bezier Curve Segment Generator:
This project generates a bezier curve segment from the four control points that the user gives as input.

Executing the project:
	-Download these files: "main.ipynb" and "Bez.ipynb" 
	-Run the "main.ipynb" file.
	-An INPUT_WINDOW should open up.
	-Enter the coordinates by clicking on the respective coordinate buttons for the respective control points.
	-Click on "PLOT CURVE" button.
	-A new window with the curve plotted should open up.
	-To enter different set of coordinates, edit values in the INPUT_WINDOW.
	-Hit the "PLOT CURVE" button to generate the new curve segment with new set of control points.
